# EditSQL Experiments

## 1. Description
This folder contains implementation of **interactive EditSQL parser**, which uses EditSQL as a base semantic parser in our MISP framework:
- Please follow [2. General Environment Setup](#2-general-environment-setup) and set up the environment/data;
- For testing interactive EditSQL on the fly (our EMNLP'19 setting), see [3. MISP with EditSQL](#3-misp-with-editsql);
- For learning EditSQL from user interaction (our EMNLP'20 setting), see [4. Learning EditSQL from user interaction (EMNLP'20)](#4-learning-editsql-from-user-interaction-emnlp20).

The implementation is adapted from [the EditSQL repository](https://github.com/ryanzhumich/editsql).

## 2. General Environment Setup
### Environment
- Please install the Anaconda environment from [`gpu-py3.yml`](../gpu-py3.yml):
    ```
    conda env create -f gpu-py3.yml
    ```
- Download the Glove word embedding from [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip) \(use `wget` for command line\) and put it as `EditSQL/word_emb/glove.840B.300d.txt`.

- Download Pretrained BERT model from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f_LEWVgrtZLRuoiExJa5fNzTS8-WcAX9/view?usp=sharing) as `EditSQL/model/bert/data/annotated_wikisql_and_PyTorch_bert_param/pytorch_model_uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12.bin`. If using command line: 
```
gdown https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1f_LEWVgrtZLRuoiExJa5fNzTS8-WcAX9
```


### Data
We have the pre-processed and cleaned [Spider data](https://yale-lily.github.io/spider) available: [data_clean.tar](https://buckeyemailosu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/chen_8336_buckeyemail_osu_edu/EbCsSRb8MKVNiVktVsze5GMBxp9TccTRSjZpT-VYB6tNpg?e=7ilzZW).
Please download and uncompress it via `tar -xvf data_clean.tar` as a folder `EditSQL/data_clean`. 
Note that the training set has been cleaned with its size reduced (see [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00689.pdf), Appendix B.3 for details).


## 3. MISP with EditSQL
We explain how to build and test EditSQL under MISP following our EMNLP'19 setting.

### 3.1 Model training
To train EditSQL on the full training set, please revise `SETTING=''` (empty string) in [scripts/editsql/pretrain.sh](../scripts/editsql/pretrain.sh).
In the main directory, run:
```
bash scripts/editsql/pretrain.sh
```

### 3.2 Model testing without interaction
To test EditSQL (trained on the full training set) regularly, in [scripts/editsql/test.sh](../scripts/editsql/test.sh), 
please revise `SETTING=''` (empty string) to ensure the `LOGDIR` loads the desired model checkpoint.
In the main directory, run:
``` 
bash scripts/editsql/test.sh
```

### 3.3 Model testing with simulated user interaction
To test EditSQL (trained on the full training set) with human interaction under the MISP framework, in [scripts/editsql/test_with_interaction.sh](../scripts/editsql/test_with_interaction.sh),
revise `SETTING='full_train'` to ensure the `LOGDIR` loads the desired model checkpoint.
In the main directory, run:
```
bash scripts/editsql/test_with_interaction.sh
```


## 4. Learning EditSQL from user interaction (EMNLP'20)
### 4.1 Pretraining

#### 4.1.1 Pretrain by yourself
Before interactive learning, we pretrain the EditSQL parser with 10% of the full training set. 
Please ensure `SETTING='_10p'` in [scripts/editsql/pretrain.sh](../scripts/editsql/pretrain.sh).
Then in the main directory, run:
```
bash scripts/editsql/pretrain.sh
```
When the training is finished, please rename and move the best model checkpoint from `EditSQL/logs_clean/logs_spider_editsql_10p/pretraining/save_X` 
to `EditSQL/logs_clean/logs_spider_editsql_10p/model_best.pt`.

#### 4.1.2 Use our pretrained checkpoint
You can also use our pretrained checkpoint: [logs_clean.tar](https://buckeyemailosu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/chen_8336_buckeyemail_osu_edu/EQmsNq-xPpBJk7iBURgT1o4BzuFX5S329AfcWU9SEMzRGQ?e=CPUNu5).
Please download and uncompress the content as `EditSQL/logs_clean/ogs_spider_editsql_10p/model_best.pt`.


#### 4.1.3 Test the pretrained model
To test the pretrained parser without user interaction, see [3.2 Model testing without interaction](#32-model-testing-without-interaction).
To test the pretrained parser with simulated user interaction, see [3.3 Model testing with simulated user interaction](#33-model-testing-with-simulated-user-interaction).
Make sure `SETTING=online_pretrain_10p` is set in the scripts.
